# Deep Flattening Tool

A JavaScript utility that implements a deep array‑flattening algorithm, providing a custom recursive solution to unwrap nested arrays of any depth without using built‑in flat() or flatMap(). -fCC Lab

## Overview
This project contains the implementation of steamrollArray, a function that takes a nested array and returns a fully flattened, one‑dimensional array.
The function handles arrays of arbitrary depth and preserves the order and type of all non‑array elements.
